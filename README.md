# 🏰 Disneyland Review Analysis – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Welcome to my data analysis project exploring reviews from **Disneyland locations**, with a focus on uncovering visitor trends, sentiment, and categorical breakdowns across different years, locations, and branches.

---

## 📊 Objective

This project aims to perform **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on Disneyland reviews to understand **visitor sentiment**, **review activity patterns**, and **key categorical insights** like reviewer location and branch distribution.

---

## 🔍 Data Source

The dataset includes reviews of Disneyland across several global branches. Key columns include:

- **Year** of review  
- **Review text**  
- **Branch**  
- **Reviewer location**  
- **Rating / Sentiment (Positive, Neutral, Negative)**  

---

## 🧪 Process Followed

This project follows a structured **Data Analysis Process**:

1. **Define Objectives** – Identify patterns and insights from Disneyland reviews  
2. **Data Collection** – Load the dataset containing reviews and metadata  
3. **Data Cleaning** – Handle missing values, fix formatting issues, remove duplicates  
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Identify patterns using plots and summaries

## 📈 Highlights from EDA

### 1. Temporal Analysis of Reviews
- Most reviews were concentrated between **2014 and 2016**, with a peak in **2015**  
- Review frequency dropped before 2014 and after 2016 

### 2. Sentiment Distribution
- Positive reviews dominate overall sentiment  
- Clear visualization of positive, neutral, and negative feedback proportions  

### 3. Reviewer Location & Branch Analysis
- **United States** had the highest number of reviewers  
- **Disneyland California** received the most reviews, followed by **Hong Kong** and **Paris**  
- Cross-tab analysis highlights top reviewer countries per branch

## 💡 Key Takeaways

- Disneyland California is the most reviewed branch  
- Reviewer sentiment is largely positive, with nuanced differences across locations  
- The distribution of reviewers by country offers opportunities for branch-specific strategies  

---

## 🚀 Looking forward to...

Moving beyond EDA, I plan to:
- Perform **text analysis** on the review content using NLP techniques  
- Engineer features for **predictive modeling** (e.g., sentiment classification from text)  
- Build an **interactive dashboard** using Power BI or Tableau to explore data in real time

## 🛠 Tools Used

- **Python** (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- **Google Colab**
